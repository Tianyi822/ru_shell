# Introduce

This is a command line terminal developed in Rust, and 'ru-shell' is just a temporary name. It will be renamed once the basic functionality is completed. 

Currently, this project is solely for practicing Rust after learning it. As for whether it will be used as a production-level project later, I'll decide after further learning. Right now, the project seems quite rudimentary.

At the moment, only the 'ls' command has been implemented, and the implementation of the 'grep' command is in progress. However, a lot of things have been happening at home recently, so the development progress has slowed down significantly.
